# word-spelling-corrector

Based on Peter Norvig’s algorithm, Peter spelling corrector is fairly famous in nerd-circles as it describes the first steps in creating a Google-style spelling corrector that will take something like “Speling”, recognise its closest word and reply “Did you mean Spelling?”.

His original is a few years old now, and only 21 lines of compact Python. Here is my attempt to convert it to C#. There are already some links to C# conversions on Peter Norvig’s page, however I wanted one that was closer to C# and didn’t rely on a 3rd party library for collection helpers.
